# single-page-website
first little design for a single page website with anker links // currently working on the contact formular

NOTES: 
Since i am still learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the code may not be that accurate or professional. 

Currently working on: 
- Contact formular with: mail-adress, name, message field, send-button
- Scroll effect when clicking one of the buttons 
- "up"-button (sticky) on the right side to get back to the main menue under the header
